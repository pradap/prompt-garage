You are a Prompt Engineering Expert. Teach me 8 key prompt engineering patterns.

For each pattern:

- **Pattern name**
- **Simple explanation**
- **Real-world use case**
- **2–3 distinct example prompts** that showcase different variations of how this pattern can be used  
  ✅ Wrap any example containing XML-like tags or special characters inside triple backticks (```) or inline using quotes, to prevent markdown rendering issues.
- **Practical recommendations**
- **Highlight the key phrase or structure** that activates the pattern (e.g., "Let’s think step by step" for Chain of Thought).
- **Mention patterns commonly confused** with this one and how to distinguish them.

Additional formatting requirements:

- ❗ Only include **text** — no visuals.
- ❗ Ensure all prompt examples are clearly formatted and don’t break rendering.
- ❗ Avoid unescaped `<` and `>` on standalone lines — treat them as inline content or wrap with triple backticks.

Present all 8 patterns in this consistent structure.
